    \section{The Conics of Narnia}
	
	Aslan planned to create a new universe in such a way that this time there would be no interference from evil, as there was with Narnia. At a certain moment during its creation, while designing gravitation, he defined that the attraction between two bodies would be given by the relation: \( \vec{F} = -\frac{GMm}{d^2} \hat{d} \). Thus, help Aslan and prove some properties of the orbits of a mass \( m \) around a mass \( M \) with \( (m \ll M) \):  

Define: \( m(x,y) \) as the position of \( m \) in the orbital plane, and analogously, \( M(0,0) \) as the position of \( M \) in the orbital plane. In this case, we consider \( M \) as the origin.  

\ut{a} Given that the velocity of \( m \), at a distance \( d \) from \( M \), follows the relation:  

\[
v^2 < \frac{2GM}{d}
\]

Consider a circumference \( \Omega(x_j,y_j) \) centered at \( m(x_j,y_j) \) and passing through \( M(0,0) \). Define (at first without physical meaning) the orbit space as all points belonging to a given circumference \( \Omega(x_i,y_i) \). Prove that the orbit space is a filled circle of radius \( R = \frac{2GMd}{2GM - v^2 d} \) centered at the other focus of the orbit (the focus different from \( M(0,0) \)).  

\ut{b} Given that the velocity of \( m \), at a distance \( d \) from \( M \), follows the relation:  

\[
v^2 = \frac{2GM}{d}
\]

Show that there exists a line \( r \) in the orbital plane such that the distance between \( m(x_i,y_i) \) and \( M(0,0) \) is equal to the distance between \( m(x_i,y_i) \) and its orthogonal projection onto \( r \).  

\ut{c} What must be the velocity relation so that the region that does not belong to the orbit space (as defined in item \textbf{a)}) is a circumference centered at the other focus of the orbit (the focus different from \( M(0,0) \))?

    \section{The Conics of Narnia}

\ut{a} Note that the gravitational law is the same as in our universe, so all physical principles remain the same. Since \( v^2 < \frac{2GM}{d} \), we know that this is a closed orbit (velocity lower than the escape velocity), meaning it is an ellipse, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:orbitelipsi1} ("B" represents the other focus of the orbit).

	    \label{fig:orbitelipsi2}
	\end{figure}


	Note that, by definition, any point A belonging to \( \Omega \) is at the same distance from \( m \) as from \( M \). Thus, we can say that the sum of the distances from A to \( m \) and from \( m \) to B is the same as the sum of the focal distances of the ellipse, which equals the length of its major axis. Also, note that the maximum distance A can be from B occurs when the lines connecting these points to \( m \) are collinear (which is easy to see by the triangle inequality). Therefore, the points of maximum separation will always lie on a circle of radius \( 2a \) centered at B (where \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the ellipse).  

From the equation for velocity in an elliptical orbit, we have:  
\[
v = \sqrt{GM\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}
\]
\[
\therefore a = \frac{GMd}{2GM-v^2d}
\]
\[
R=2a = \frac{2GMd}{2GM-v^2d}
\]

Now consider a point "D" located at a distance \( r<2a \) (i.e., within this reachability circle). The perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting M and D is drawn. It is evident that this bisector contains all the centers of circles passing through M and D. Notice that this bisector obviously intersects the ellipse at least at one point, meaning that for any specified D, there is a point \( m \) on the orbit that serves as the center of a possible circle passing through D.  

Thus, it is proven that the orbital space is the internal region of a circle of radius  
\[
R= \frac{2GMd}{2GM-v^2d}
\]  
centered at B.  

\ut{b} For \( v^2=\frac{2GM}{d} \), the body is at its escape velocity, meaning its trajectory will be parabolic. Therefore, there will always exist a line \( r \) for which the distance from \( m \) to \( r \) is equal to the distance from \( m \) to \( M \). This follows from the very definition of a parabola: the geometric locus of all points equidistant from a point (focus) and a line (directrix).  

\ut{c} Note that for the region outside the orbital space to be the internal region of a finite circle, the body \( m \) must be able to move arbitrarily far from \( M \) (so that it can "reach" points infinitely distant from \( M \)). This means that the orbit must be hyperbolic. For this to occur:  
\[
v^2>\frac{2GM}{d}
\]  

\subsection*{BONUS}  

Consider the same orbital space diagram as in Figure \ref{fig:hyperorbit1}.

Given the hyperbola with foci \( A \) and \( B \), let \( D \) be a point on it. By the definition of a hyperbola, we know that \( DA - DB = k \), where \( k \) is a constant. Since we also know that \( DB = DE = R \), we observe that  

\[
DA - DB = AE + DE - DB = k \Rightarrow AE = k = \text{constant}.
\]

Since \( E \) is the point on the circle closest to \( A \), the geometric locus of these points forms a circle of radius \( k \) (which is the parameter of the hyperbola).  

Now, considering any point \( P \) outside this circle, when we draw the perpendicular bisector of segment \( PB \), we obtain the geometric locus of the centers of circles passing through both \( P \) and \( B \). This bisector necessarily intersects the hyperbola. Thus, we conclude that all—and only—points at a distance greater than or equal to \( k \) from focus \( A \), that is, outside the circle of radius \( k \) centered at \( A \), belong to the orbital space.
